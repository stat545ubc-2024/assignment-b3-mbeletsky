# Welcome to Maria Beletsky's Assignment B3 for STAT 545B. 

This repo contains source materials for a Shiny application made with the "shiny"
R package.

My Shiny app shows Grizzly bear population data in British Columbia, Canada, in 2015 and 2018. 
The dataset used was obtained [here](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/grizzly-bear-population-estimates), from the BC Data Catalogue.

To access the app, click here.

The app shows a subset of the BC grizzly bear population data from 2015 and 2018. 
In the app, you can select the year to view and then view a table showing bear 
population in each population sub-unit for that year and a plot showing how 
population sub-unit size (number of bears) varies with territory area in that year.
