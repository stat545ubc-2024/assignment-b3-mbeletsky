# Welcome to the folder with all the app contents!

This folder contains everything needed for the assignmentb3-mbeletsky app to run. 

## Files

The "app.R" file contains code for the Shiny app itself and the "grizzly.csv" file 
contains a subset of the dataset I am using obtained from the [BC Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/grizzly-bear-population-estimates).

## Folders

The "rsconnect" folder stores deployment records for the app and the "www" folder 
contains an image of grizzly bears that is displayed in the app.
